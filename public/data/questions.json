Each Availability Zone contains one public subnet and one private subnet. The service runs on Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnets. An Application Load Balancer in the public subnets is in front of the service. The service needs to communicate with the internet and does so through two NAT gateways. The service uses Amazon S3 for image storage. The EC2 instances retrieve approximately 1 ТВ of data from an S3 bucket each day. The company has promoted the service as highly secure. A solutions architect must reduce cloud expenditures as much as possible without compromising the service’s security posture or increasing the time spent on ongoing operations.

    "question": "An entertainment company recently launched a new game. To ensure a good experience for players during the launch period, the company deployed a static quantity of 12 r6g.16xlarge (memory optimized) Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer. The company's operations team used the Amazon CloudWatch agent and a custom metric to include memory utilization in its monitoring strategy. Analysis of the CloudWatch metrics from the launch period showed consumption at about one quarter of the CPU and memory that the company expected. Initial demand for the game has subsided and has become more variable. The company decides to use an Auto Scaling group that monitors the CPU and memory consumption to dynamically scale the instance fleet. A solutions architect needs to configure the Auto Scaling group to meet demand in the most cost-effective way. Which solution will meet these requirements?",

These maintenance tasks, which include updates and patches to the application servers, cause downtime. While an application server is down, data is lost from sensors because the remaining servers cannot handle the entire workload.
